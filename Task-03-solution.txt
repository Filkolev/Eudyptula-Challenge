Having already explored git format-patch and git send-email for task 01,
completing this one was a breeze. I just modified the Makefile as instructed,
created a patch and emailed it. Proof of booting the kernel was the
output of `cat /proc/version' within the commit message of the patch.
Since the change is trivial, there is not much else to take into account.
As for the first task, I checked the patch using scripts/checkpatch.pl.
