For this task I basically followed the same steps as for Task 02, except
I skipped the `make localmodconfig' part and I found out why it was
specifically mentioned before.
I pulled linux-next snapshot for October 23 from the linux-next repository and
also added the linux-next tree as a remote to my Linux repository.

What is linux-next is described in the book Documentation/process.

Verify running kernel:
[filip@arch ~]$ cat /proc/version
