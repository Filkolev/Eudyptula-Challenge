For this task I looked first in Documentation/driver-api/misc_devices.rst,
then to the file this points to, drivers/char/misc.c. This includes
include/linux/miscdevice.h where I found useful macros. I searched the
repository for users of one of the macros and found several examples of
how to setup the driver.

The final problem was properly defining the write and read functions. Found
a suggestion online to use helper functions which simplify the task as they
perform various checks and modify the appropriate pointers. The issue was
infinite read when testing with `cat'.
