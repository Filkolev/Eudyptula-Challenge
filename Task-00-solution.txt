The Challenge is not available for new participants at all times. At the time
I learned about it, the site eudyptula-challenge.org had the following
paragraph.

=====

Unfortunately right now the Eudyptula challenge is not accepting new
applicants. It has had over 19 thousand developers sign up over the past
three years, and is currently taking a bit of time off to let the existing
applicants finish the tasks. After that happens, it will return in a probably
different format than the existing one was.

Yeah, we know, you just now found out about this and really really really
want to be let in to do the tasks. Well, you can always attempt to bribe the 
set of shell scripts to do so. How you can do that will be left as an
exercise for the reader, consider it your "task 00" to complete.

=====

As suggested, to enter the challenge at this time, you'll need to show that
you really want to join. Also you'll need to bribe the scripts, like, for
real; they may be just (convoluted) scripts, but they have dreams too.
