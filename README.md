# Eudyptula Challenge

## What is it?

The Eudyptula Challenge is a series of Linux kernel programming exercises. More information can be found at [eudyptula-challenge.org](http://eudyptula-challenge.org/).

## What does this repository contain?

Per the official instructions and given the educational and entertainment purpose of the challenge, this repository will not contain any actual source code.

There will be a single text file for each task containing the task description and another file with my personal notes on the solution - e.g. what sources I used, what parts of the kernel did I look at, etc.
