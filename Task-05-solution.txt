The files I examined for this task:
- Documentation/driver-api/usb/hotplug.rst
- include/linux/usb.h
- include/uapi/linux/hid.h
- include/linux/hid.h
- include/linux/mod_devicetable.h
- drivers/hid/usbhid/usbkbd.c

The last one, usbkbd.c, was the most useful as I practically copied over the 
necessary parts, modifying variable and function names.

Building and installing the module was more involved. I had to generate a
signing key, following Documentation/admin-guide/module-signing.rst and a
Stackoverflow post.

With this implementation, I got a response that the struct usb_driver 
structure was not needed, hence, there was no requirement for the driver to 
register itself with the USB subsystem. I pretty much removed most of the code, 
and brought back the init and exit functions (which were not implemented in the 
previous version).
