In this task, debugfs APIs need to be replaced with sysfs.

These are the documents I looked at:
- https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/sysfs.html
- https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/core-api/kobject.html

The relevant headers are:
- include/linux/sysfs.h
- include/linux/device.h

Also useful are these examples:
- samples/kobject/kobject-example.c
- samples/kobject/kset-example.c

In short, there are macros that can be used to define the sysfs attributes 
with correct permissions given proper naming of the show and store functions.
There are also macros to help with defining attribute groups. Used with a 
function to add sysfs groups, everything is accomplished with a few lines of 
code.

The rest of the code is largely unchanged from Task 08.
